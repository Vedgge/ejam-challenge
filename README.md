## Challenge Implementation

The challenge for this project was to recreate the provided Figma design as accurately as possible while ensuring a responsive and functional implementation. To achieve this, the following steps were taken:

1. **Design Analysis**: The Figma design was thoroughly analyzed to understand the layout, typography, color scheme, and overall aesthetic.
2. **Component Breakdown**: The design was broken down into individual components and sections, making it easier to manage and develop.
3. **Responsive Approach**: A mobile-first approach was adopted, ensuring the page was optimized for smaller screens before scaling up to larger displays.
4. **Tailwind CSS Integration**: Tailwind CSS was integrated into the project to streamline the styling process and leverage its utility classes for efficient CSS development.
5. **Pixel-Perfect Implementation**: Careful attention was paid to ensuring that the final implementation matched the Figma design as closely as possible, achieving a pixel-perfect result.
